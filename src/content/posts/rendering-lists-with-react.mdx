**Background:** This post discusses React Hooks and JavaScript Array methods (i.e. `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()`). For more information on either topic, check out these great resources:

- **React**: Kent Dodd's [The Beginner's Guide to React](https://egghead.io/courses/the-beginner-s-guide-to-react) (free)
- **Array methods**: Will Sentance's [Hard Parts: Functional Programming](https://frontendmasters.com/workshops/hard-parts-functional-js/) (requires [Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com/) subscription)

## Starting Point

Once mastered, JavaScript's Array methods are wonderfully expressive tools for simple and readable data manipulation. In my experience, a better understanding of data transformation makes codes easier to read, test, and maintain. That said, once you've distilled your data into its most concise form, you'll want to render it in a similarly expressive manner. 

Before we get started, take a look at the following example:

```jsx
const List = ({ children }) => <ul>{children}</ul>
const Item = ({ children }) => (
  <li>
    <label><input type="checkbox" {...props} /> {children}</label>
  </li>
)
List.Item = Item

const ChecklistExample = () => (
  <div>
    <h1>Daily objectives</h1>
    <List>
      <List.Item checked>Write blog post</List.Item>
      <List.Item checked>Make some coffee</List.Item>
      <List.Item checked={false}>Profit</List.Item>
    </List>
  </div>
)
```

The previous example is common practice for lists of known length, it has convenient abstractions and is easy to reason about. Inevitably though, requirements change over time; we'll want to introduce any of pagination, filtering, sorting, or database storage.

In order to facilitate those updates, we'll need to modify the previosu example to loop through our variable length collection of data and render a `<List.Item />` for each entry in the database.

```jsx
const DatabaseExample = ({ items = [] }) => (
  <div>
    <h1>Daily objectives</h1>
    <List>
      {items.map(item => (
        <List.Item 
          key={item.id}
          checked={item.complete}
        >
          {item.description}
        </List.Item>
      ))}
    </List>
  </div>
)
```


Using `array.map` is idiomatic and ubiquitous throughout React codebases, but there is room for improvement. In the next section, we'll be rewriting this with a `<ListView />` abstraction [inspired by React Native](https://reactnative.dev/docs/flatlist) which is less concerned with DOM structure, data structure, or visual appearance and more focused on the facilitation of common UI patterns when displaying collections of data.

## New Challenger Approaches

First, let's create ListView then loop through our data calling the `render()` prop for each iteration.

```jsx
const ListView = ({ 
  items = [], 
  render = () => {} 
}) => (
  <>
    {array.map(render)}
  </>
)

const Example = ({ items = [] }) => (
  <div>
    <h1>Daily objectives</h1>
    <List>
      <ListView
        items={items}
        render={(item, idx) => (
          <List.Item 
            key={item.id}
            checked={item.complete}
          >
            {item.description}
          </List.Item>
        )}
      />
    </List>
  </div>
)
```

This works reasonably well, but we still have to wrap our ListView in the List element to ensure we retain the `ul > li` semantics in the HTML. To fix that, we can add an optional wrapper.


```jsx
const ListView = ({ 
  items = [], 
  render = () => {}, 
  container: Container = React.Fragment 
}) => (
  <Container>
    {array.map(render)}
  </Container>
)

const Example = ({ items = [] }) => (
  <div>
    <h1>Daily objectives</h1>
    <ListView
      items={items}
      container={List}
      render={(item, idx) => (
        <List.Item 
          key={item.id}
          checked={item.complete}
        >
          {item.description}
        </List.Item>
      )}
    />
  </div>
)
```

## Adding to the API

With our minimally viable ListView, we're now on strong footing to add functionality to simplify common list patterns. It may be tempting to immediately add `header` and `footer` props, but while those are certainly helpful in some circumstances, they suggest a vertical orientation which is not always the case in grids or horizontal carousels. Instead, it would be more generally usefl to render content *before* or *after* the body of data, so let's use that directionally-independent naming convention instead. 

```jsx
const ListView = ({ 
  items = [], 
  render = () => {}, 
  as: Wrapper = React.Fragment,
  container: Container = React.Fragment,
  before = null,
  after =  null
}) => (
  <Wrapper>
    {before ? before() : null}
    <Container>
      {array.map(render)}
    </Container>
    {after ? after() : null}
  </Wrapper>
)

const Example = ({ items = [] }) => (
  <ListView
    as="div"
    items={items}
    container={List}
    before={() => (
      <header>
        <h1>Daily objectives</h1>
      </header>
    )}
    render={(item, idx) => (
      <List.Item 
        key={item.id}
        checked={item.complete}
      >
        {item.description}
      </List.Item>
    )}
    after={() => (
      <footer>
        Complete: {items.filter(item => item.complete).length}
      </footer>
    )}
  />
)
```
