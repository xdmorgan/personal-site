## Notes

1. if you haven't already, run `npx create-react-app cra-with-router` in Terminal
   - I'll be using `cra-with-router` as my project name, but substitute this with whatever you prefer.
1. `cd cra-with-router`
1. next, run `yarn add react-router-dom`
1. run `yarn test` to ensure everything seems to be working
1. run `yart start` to run the local dev server
1. open the `cra-with-router` directory if your preferred editor. To open in VS Code, run `code .`
