Last week's brief glimpse of Spring was fun while it lasted, but it quickly dissipated and cold rainy weather has unfortunately returned to the <abbr title="D.C., Maryland, and Virginia">DMV</abbr>. There was so much great content this past week and a bit, well that or I'm stuck inside and reading a lot more‚ÄîProbably both.

## Top Highlight

Josh Comeau's article, [A Static Future](https://joshwcomeau.com/gatsby/a-static-future/), does an awesome job explaining the power of modern static site generators, its clarifies some of the strengths and weaknesses of popular libraries like [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and is a great introduction to the topic.

**Speaking of Gatsby:** This site uses a custom Gatsby theme to aggregate and configure popular Gatsby plugins (like a [toolkit dependency](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/concerning-toolkits)). It centralizes dependency management and provides quickstart support for TypeScript, Sass, MDX, and other opinionated nice-to-haves. Check it out on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gatsby-theme-xdmorgan) and [GitHub](https://github.com/xdmorgan/gatsby-theme-xdmorgan).
