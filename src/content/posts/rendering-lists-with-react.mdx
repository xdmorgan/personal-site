**Heads up:** This post assumes familiarity with Hooks-era React and JavaScript Array methods (i.e. `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()`). For more information on either topic, I'd recommend these amazing resources:

- **React**: Kent Dodd's [The Beginner's Guide to React](https://egghead.io/courses/the-beginner-s-guide-to-react) (free)
- **Array methods**: Will Sentance's [Hard Parts: Functional Programming](https://frontendmasters.com/workshops/hard-parts-functional-js/) (requires [Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com/) subscription)

## Status Quo

Once mastered, JavaScript's Array methods become wonderfully expressive tools for simple and readable data manipulation. That said, once you've shaped your data, you'll want to render it in a similarly ergonomic manner. If you've used React long enough, you'll have certainly come across something like the following:

```jsx
const ToDos = ({ items = [] }) => (
  <ul>
    {items.map(item => <li key={item.text}>{item.text}</li>}
  </ul>
)
```

This is fine in some circumstances, but is there a more useful alternative? Thanksfully, there is! Enter the ListView component [inspired by React Native](https://reactnative.dev/docs/flatlist).
