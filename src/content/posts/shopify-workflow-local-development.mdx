## Shopify Workflow Series

- Part 1: Local Development & Theme Versioning
- Part 2: Automated Deployment with GitHub Actions (coming soon)

## Environment Setup

Before we can get started, you'll need a few things in order to follow along:

- A [GitHub account](https://github.com) with [an SSH key configured](https://help.github.com/en/enterprise/2.15/user/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account) to store our theme.
- A [Shopify Partner Program](https://www.shopify.com/partners) account with access to your desired Store/theme so we can grant API permissions to sync our local work with the remote server.
- One of [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) or [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) package managers. If you're a Mac user like myself, Homebrew should be preinstalled and available in Terminal.

## Installing the Shopify Theme CLI

Shopify has a number of tools to support different developer workflows. For theme development, we will need at least the [Shopify Theme Kit CLI](https://github.com/Shopify/themekit) installed and authenticated.

Follow [the instructions here](https://shopify.github.io/themekit/) to install the CLI (`themekit`) and any supporting libraries (`shopify/shopify`).

Once complete, typing `theme` into Terminal should yield something like the following output:

```sh

Shoify ThemeKit CLI
Version 420

```
